Tsc_initial = [1 0 0 1; 0 1 0 0; 0 0 1 0.025; 0 0 0 1]
Tsc_final = [0 1 0 0; -1 0 0 -1; 0 0 1 0.025; 0 0 0 1]
k = 10
Kp = 1.98 
Ki = 0.8

Interestingly, this amount of overshoot only happened at a very specific amount of Kp. A Kp value of 2 made the system unstable, one of 1.99 had too much overshoot, and one of 1.97 had almost no overshoot. So 1.98 was just right.
See Good Overshoot and Too Little Overshoot Graphs for comparison.
